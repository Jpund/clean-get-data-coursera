==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

# The data provided is a table of the mean of the measures of the variable indicated for each activity for each participant. 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

# - 'README.txt': describing the analysis files.

# - tidied.pdf : a dataframe resulting from the application of run_analysis.R on the raw data. It is a tidy data of the mean of the measures of the variable indicated for each activity for each participant.

# The script run_analysis.R : a script to performing the analysis of the raw data into the tidy data that is tidied.pdf.

# This CodeBook explaining the variables, the data ((https://github.com/Jpund/clean-get-data-coursera/files/9700899/datatidy.pdf)), and the transformations that have been performed on the data.

# The raw used is : 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. The variables estimated from these signals are used here are the ones related to the mean()and the the std() Standard deviation. The mean value was calculated for each mean and standard deviation related value for each patern (tBodyAcc-XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ, tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyro-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ, tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag, fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccMag, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag) for each activity of each participant.
Thanks to the raw data : 'train/X_train.txt': Training set,'train/y_train.txt': Training labels, 'test/X_test.txt': Test set and 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Then the train and test data sets were merged into one dataset.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
